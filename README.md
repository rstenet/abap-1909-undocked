# abap-1909-undocked

Three months ago SAP has released new Develope Edition [SAP ABAP Platform 1909](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/15/sap-abap-platform-1909-developer-edition-available-soon/comment-page-1/). The euphoria is great: new features, has HANA as DB and on top of all runs in Docker. Super easy to install on Linux, Windowd and macOS, even for newbies. Yeah!

Looking at the requirements the euphoria begins to disappear. 16GB RAM and 150GB Disk.
